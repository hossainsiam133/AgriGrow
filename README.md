# 🎓 GradeGenius: Student Performance Predictor

GradeGenius is a machine learning-based project that predicts student final exam performance (pass/fail or score) based on a variety of factors such as:

- Attendance
- Study time
- Previous grades
- Parental background
- Demographic and socio-economic data

The goal is to support educators and institutions by providing early warnings and insights into student performance patterns.
